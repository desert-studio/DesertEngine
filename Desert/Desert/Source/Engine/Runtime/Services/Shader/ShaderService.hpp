         * @brief The program @p name compiled under @p variant — a SECOND object for the same file,

         *
         * THE CALLER OWNS IT, and that is the design and not an accident. A material authoring a cloud
         * medium produces a new variant on every edit of its graph, and each variant owns VkShaderModules
         * and descriptor set layouts; a service-owned cache would grow by one program per edit for the
         * life of the session and never release one. So the service keeps only a WEAK reference: two
         * layers whose medium is the same text share one program, and the last holder dropping it is what
         * frees the modules. Hand it back by simply releasing the shared_ptr.
         *
         * The default variant is refused rather than served: that is what GetByName is for, and answering
         * it here would build a second, unregistered copy of a program that already exists.
         *
         * @return nullptr when the name is unknown, when @p variant is default, when the asset behind the
         *         name has expired, or when the substituted source DID NOT COMPILE — each logged with the
         *         name, never silently.
         *
         * The last of those was added by О1-G and is the one worth reading twice: a program with no
         * compiled stages used to be returned, on the stated ground that the caller would decide. Neither
         * caller did, and an uncompiled program reaches VulkanPipelineCompute::Invalidate, which indexes
         * element 0 of the stage list a failed compile leaves empty. An answer a caller cannot use is a
         * refusal; returning it as a success is the "empty successful answer" the contract forbids.
