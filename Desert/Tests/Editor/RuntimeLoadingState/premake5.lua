-- "The shipping host has a loading state, and it is the thing that gates the present."
--
-- Read from the SOURCES at run time. Every relation below lives between a type in the engine and call
-- sites in two files no header includes -- which host constructs its gate shut, which branch the scene
-- blit sits inside, whether either host kept a second copy of the rule -- and none of them is visible
-- to a compiler or to a unit test. Same shape as AsyncAssetPump beside it.
--
-- Editor/Source and Runtime/Source are on the include path because the capture flags' parser
-- (Runtime/Source/RuntimeShot.hpp) is header-only and is tested here as code rather than as text.
