    -- The subject is the PROCEDURAL producer of phase Э5: Engine/Assets/CloudProceduralVolume.cpp, the
    -- hash that places the lumps and the bake that turns them into a camera-centric periodic volume.
    --
    -- CloudModellingVolume.cpp comes with it because the sculpting maths is SHARED rather than copied —
    -- the distances, the join's term and the join itself are that file's, called by this one. A suite that
    -- stubbed them would be testing a second implementation instead of the one that ships.
    --
    -- The shader root is on the include path for one header: Common/CloudGeometry.glslh, compiled as C++,
    -- which is what lets the generator's lump-size clamp be asserted against the march's OWN search step
    -- rather than against a number typed out twice.
