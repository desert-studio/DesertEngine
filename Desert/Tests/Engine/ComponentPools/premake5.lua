-- Every component type an ECS system touches must have its pool created BEFORE the parallel phase.
--
-- EnTT creates a pool on the FIRST touch of a type and that creation writes to the registry even through
-- a const reference, so two collectors running concurrently in Scene::ExecuteSystems race on a
-- std::vector grow. Scene::PrepareComponentPools closes the race by creating every pool serially; this
-- suite is what keeps that list complete, because an omission compiles and only shows up as
-- `std::length_error: vector` in about one headless run in fifty.
--
-- NOTHING IS LINKED FROM THE ENGINE. The audit reads the system headers and Scene.cpp as TEXT, which is
-- the only way to ask "which types does this file ask the registry about" without a GPU, a scene and a
-- job pool. It also means the suite cannot go stale against a build.
