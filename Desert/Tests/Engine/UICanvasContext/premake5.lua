-- First test coverage of Engine/UI. Until this suite existed, scripts/CI/UnreachedSources.sh listed all
-- three of its translation units among the 275 that no suite compiles, UICanvasRenderer2D.cpp included --
-- 1837 lines driving every UI element the engine has, checked by nothing.
--
-- The seam was already there and had simply never been used: RenderCanvas2D takes a plain entt::registry
-- and a DrawList2D, and DrawList2D is the pure CPU geometry builder with no GPU or Vulkan in it. So the
-- walk runs headless, and what it drew is readable back out of the vertex buffer.
--
-- WHAT IS STUBBED AND WHY. The renderer resolves sprites, fonts, icons and video through
-- Runtime::ResourceRegistry, whose services own GPU objects. The test defines those accessors itself and
-- returns nullptr: every draw helper already handles an absent service (a sprite that will not resolve
-- falls back to its flat colour, text draws nothing), which is exactly the path a headless walk wants.
