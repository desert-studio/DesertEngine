-- "The canvas is drawn OVER the 3D, it answers the pointer, and neither stops being true when the view
-- changes" (Ю18).
--
-- WHY THIS SUITE AND NOT A FRAME. Half of the property is a position in a Vulkan command buffer, which no
-- test on this machine can observe and which a frame observes only indirectly. That half is expressed as
-- a REGISTER instead -- RenderPhase::k_DeferredOverlayPhases -- and asserted here on plain integers, with
-- the graph's own sort (Engine/Graphic/RenderGraphSort.hpp, header-only) for the ordering it depends on.
-- The other half -- the canvas walk over a registry that also holds a camera, a light and meshes, and the
-- pointer election surviving the view being pointed at another scene and back -- is pure C++ and is
-- asserted directly.
--
-- The frame half of the witness lives in scripts/MacOS/UIOverSceneWitness.sh, which drives a live editor
-- A->B->A through the control channel and finds the canvas's marker panel in the picture. It cannot run
-- in CI; this can.
--
-- Stubs: identical to Desert/Tests/Engine/UIListView -- the renderer resolves sprites, fonts, icons and
-- video through Runtime::ResourceRegistry, whose services own GPU objects, and every draw helper already
-- copes with the service being absent.
